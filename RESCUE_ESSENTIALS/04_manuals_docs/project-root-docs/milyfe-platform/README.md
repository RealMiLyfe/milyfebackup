## What is MiLyfe?

MiLyfe is civic infrastructure — not a social network, not a campaign app. It is a full-stack platform that gives communities the tools to self-govern, build shared wealth, and support each other without intermediaries.

One account. Your whole civic life. **Free forever.**

> "The Constitution as something you live. A system that still works after anyone leaves."

---

## The Proof

Built with **$0 in outside capital** over **11 years** of independent work. Not a pitch deck. Not a prototype. A running, auditable platform anyone can inspect, fork, and run.

| What | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Cost to build** | $0 (every tool is free and open source) |
| **Time** | 11 years |
| **Routes** | 38 pages · 20 API routes |
| **Database** | 48 tables · 108 Row-Level Security policies |
| **Corporate equivalent** | ~$3M+ |
| **Live at** | [milyfe.fun](https://milyfe.fun) |

---

## What it does

```
Pocket     →  $MLY weekly UBI · transactions · community treasury
Learn      →  Free education paths · offline-capable
Street     →  Quests · local marketplace · surplus exchange
Voice      →  Proposals · direct democracy · standing votes
You        →  Profile · health · safety · connections · wiki
Mi         →  Local AI assistant (no cloud required)
```

Every feature works offline. Every vote is public. No ads. No data extraction. No permanent power.

## The Oath — 24 Immutable Principles

> *"We the People of the United States... do ordain and establish this Constitution."*
> — Preamble to the U.S. Constitution

MiLyfe begins where the American promise begins — **We the People** — and treats it as universal. Anyone, anywhere can join from day one.

**Principle 1: We the People.** Power belongs to the people and stays with them — everywhere, from day one. This is the whole play.

The other 23 principles include: free forever for rights, learning, and emergencies · no permanent power · open source forever · freedom to exit with your data · children first · truth in claims · not a state.

[Read the full Oath →](docs/planning/MiLyfe_Ultimate_Manual.md)

## $MLY — Community Credit

`$MLY` is a community credit issued by public, transparent rules. Not an investment. Not a token sale. Not a financial product.

- **Earn it** — weekly UBI to every verified member, quests, community contributions
- **Spend it** — marketplace, local shops, thanking neighbors
- **Trade it** — voluntarily, peer-to-peer, with anyone who consents
- **Save it** — personal jars, household pots, community treasury

No founder mint. No pre-mine. No APY. No "investment in our team."

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **App** | Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript | Production-ready, self-hostable |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL via Supabase | RLS at the DB, not the app layer |
| **Auth** | Supabase Auth | Open source, no vendor lock-in |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS + custom design tokens | Fast, consistent, accessible |
| **Security** | Zod + DOMPurify + RLS + client-side encryption | Defense in depth |
| **i18n** | Translated message catalogs + language selectors (14 languages, RTL-aware) | Universal from day one |
| **License** | AGPL-3.0 | Public code, stays public |

## Get started in 3 steps

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/RealMiLyfe/MiLyfe-Universal-OS
cd MiLyfe-Universal-OS

# 2. Configure
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Fill in your Supabase credentials

# 3. Run
npm install && npm run dev
```

**Database setup:** apply the migrations in `supabase/migrations/` (the canonical, versioned schema — 48 tables, 108 RLS policies). The `scripts/new-project-setup.sql` bundle is a convenience snapshot; when in doubt, the numbered migrations are the source of truth.

## The story behind it

The founder was arrested 11 times in Jacksonville, harassed hundreds more. Ate from trash cans. Bathed with a water hose. Couldn't pay child support. Built this for 11 years with $0. Nearly ended it all twice. Kept going.

His daughter stopped asking if it was done. The silence was the weight.

It's done. It runs. The code is public. Now he's running for mayor to prove it works.

> *"You can't attack a man who already told you everything and built something beautiful anyway."*
